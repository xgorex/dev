A lovestruck Romeo sings the streets of serenade Laying everybody low with a love song that he made Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade Says something like you and me babe how about it?
The majority of the estimated population of 2.2 million live in Turkey, Egypt and Iran with significant numbers in Iraq. Smaller populations are found in Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Jordan, Syria and other countries of the Middle East and North Africa.
The actual population is unknown as some Dom are excluded from national censuses and others label themselves in national terms rather than as Dom. Nowadays, they speak the dominant languages of their larger societies, but Domari, their national language, continues to be spoken by more insular communities. Iranians called them gurbati or kouli, both meaning "foreigners".
Doms also reside in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan in small numbers as well as in the Chitral, Swat, Kohistan and Ladakh regions of Pakistan and India. In Gilgit, Dom are coupled with the Kameen and Mons, who are also musicians, blacksmith and do similar menial jobs.
There is a large concentration of Dom/Gypsies in Jordan. Researchers claim that, "they accommodate Arab racism by hiding their ethnic identity," since they would not be accepted into Arabian society once their true identity is revealed.[5] Another group of Dom origin in Iran are the Lori, who are found in the Baloch regions of southeast Iran. There is also a similar small community with some colonial Romanichal ancestors in Malta. That community is called the Maltese Romanichal.
